# Excel VBA Scheduling Optimization Project

This project implements a scheduling optimization tool in Excel using VBA.  
It simulates multiple machines working in parallel at different processing speeds, and evaluates several scheduling algorithms to compare efficiency and total completion time.

## Project Overview
The system receives a set of tasks and processes them across multiple machines with different speeds.  
The VBA code automates:
- Assigning tasks to machines
- Simulating task execution in parallel
- Calculating total processing time
- Comparing different scheduling strategies


## Features
- Fully automated simulation inside Excel
- Dynamic outputs and performance metrics
- Clear visualization of machine loads and timelines

## Files
- `.xlsm` – Excel file containing the VBA macro
- `README.md` – project documentation

## Purpose of the Project
Built as a personal learning project and for practicing optimization and automation in Excel using VBA.  
Demonstrates problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and practical use of VBA for real process improvement.
